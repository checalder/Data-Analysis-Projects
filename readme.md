ðŸš§ **Work in Progress**

An in-progress end-to-end project that simulates a real NHS analyst role in elective care performance tracking. It introduces cloud integration using AWS to reflect modern NHS data pipelines.

- Simulates 3 realistic healthcare tables: appointments, wait times, and clinic capacity  
- Uses AWS RDS (PostgreSQL) to store and query data in the cloud  
- Builds a Power BI dashboard with live cloud data: RTT performance, DNA rates, and capacity breaches  
- Optional: Adds AWS Lambda automation to flag RTT breaches  

> A cloud-ready NHS informatics simulation that blends service performance tracking with stakeholder reporting and governance awareness.

**Skills I Will Learn From This Project**:
- Multi-table SQL joins across healthcare data  
- Calculating real NHS KPIs (RTT, DNA, capacity vs demand)  
- Connecting Power BI to AWS-hosted databases  
- Simulating cloud-based reporting pipelines  
- Writing executive summaries for NHS managers  
- Governance-aware data handling using pseudonymised records
