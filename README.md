# 🌍 City Air Quality Tracker

A Python + SQLite project that simulates environmental monitoring of air pollution across major UK cities. This project builds real-world skills in SQL, data analysis, and data visualization.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

This project tracks PM2.5, PM10, and NO₂ pollution across several UK cities over a 30-day period. Data is stored in SQLite, queried using SQL, analyzed with pandas, and visualized using matplotlib.
