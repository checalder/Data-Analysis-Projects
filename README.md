# Data Analysis Projects – Central Hub

Welcome to my collection of hands-on data analysis projects. Each one explores real-world datasets using tools like SQL, Power BI, and Python — showing how data can be used to tell compelling stories, spot trends, and support decision-making.

## 🧠 Skills I’ve Learned So Far

Across the projects below, I’ve gained experience in:

- Writing SQL queries to explore, aggregate, and filter datasets
- Designing and populating SQLite databases
- Building interactive dashboards in Power BI
- Connecting Python with databases for automated analysis
- Visualising trends with KPIs, line and bar charts
- Interpreting public health and operational data
- Using filters, slicers, and calculated fields in BI tools

## 📊 [City Air Quality Tracker](https://github.com/checalder/Data-Analysis-Projects/tree/Air-Quality-Dashboard)

A data project focused on monitoring air pollution across UK cities. It includes:

- A custom SQLite database storing nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) levels  
- SQL queries for trends and hotspot detection  
- Python analysis and optional visualisations  

> This dashboard explores how environmental data can help us understand public health risks and urban planning priorities.

## 🏥 [NHS A&E Dashboard](https://github.com/checalder/Data-Analysis-Projects/tree/Hospital-Tracker)

A mini analytics project inspired by NHS Informatics workflows. It demonstrates:

- SQL querying of A&E attendance data from two hospitals  
- A Power BI dashboard with KPIs, filters, and NHS 4-hour target tracking  
- Use of industry tools to simulate real-world reporting  

> Built as part of my preparation for the NHS Informatics Work Placement Scheme 2025.

## 🧾 [Elective Care Efficiency Tracker + AWS Cloud](https://github.com/checalder/Data-Analysis-Projects/tree/Elective-Care-Cloud)

🚧 **Work in Progress**

An in-progress end-to-end project that simulates a real NHS analyst role in elective care performance tracking. It introduces cloud integration using AWS to reflect modern NHS data pipelines.

- Simulates 3 realistic healthcare tables: appointments, wait times, and clinic capacity  
- Uses AWS RDS (PostgreSQL) to store and query data in the cloud  
- Builds a Power BI dashboard with live cloud data: RTT performance, DNA rates, and capacity breaches  
- Optional: Adds AWS Lambda automation to flag RTT breaches  

> A cloud-ready NHS informatics simulation that blends service performance tracking with stakeholder reporting and governance awareness.

**Skills I Will Learn From This Project**:
- Multi-table SQL joins across healthcare data  
- Calculating real NHS KPIs (RTT, DNA, capacity vs demand)  
- Connecting Power BI to AWS-hosted databases  
- Simulating cloud-based reporting pipelines  
- Writing executive summaries for NHS managers  
- Governance-aware data handling using pseudonymised records
